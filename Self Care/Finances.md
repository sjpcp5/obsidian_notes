Take home pay: 
50% to 60% rent, groceries, car, debt payments - take home pay
5 to 10% emergency fund, down payment for a car
5 to 15% investments ( more you invest the more u have)
20% to 35% take home pay to guilt free spending (treating your friends, yoga, silk shirt)


A home and car payment: You want freedom but you anchored yourself to keep you from traveling. 

I want to travel for 6 weeks a year and I want to bring two partners with me 
- travel to thailand
- travel to austrailia
- travel to london
- travel to Argentina
- travel to tokyo 
  Every where I stay I want a comfortable bed that makes me feel amazing getting in and getting out of it
  I want to have access to a tub, semi-private bath that is big enough for my partner(s) and me
