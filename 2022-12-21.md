### Undoing Git mistakes

#### Editing old commit messages
how far back in time do I want to go? how many commit messages back?
Go back as far as the parent of the commit message
`git rebase -i HEAD~3` 

the interactive presents the messages from oldest to newest

One can delete old commit messages with interactive rebase
the action word for deleting the commit from the history is  `drop`

Generally you want to make small commits instead of huge unless you have over done it. 
using `squash` will combine messages from above and below the squash then you will create a new commit message
