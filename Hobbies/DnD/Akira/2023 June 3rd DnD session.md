- Fukuar stuffs lots of rope in his bag slowly
-  The rope is tight and secure checked by Thrayrift
-  Fukuar is looking down at us from the highest level above
-  William climbs well
-  Thrayrift climbs up on Athletics, 
- We figured out how to use the unmovable rod and placed it horizontal above the rope to reach the top level
- Fukuar is an a Giant Eagle/ ice Eagle from the feylands,  now and picks up Zoi and Elder Wolfe all the way up. He is struggling. He lands roughly. Zoi and Elder Wolfe have to roll a saving throw for dexterity. Fukuar licks at the water skin of Elder Wolfe.
- I try climbing the the rope and receive rope burn , The I attempt to climb again and make 2/3rds of the way up. Thrayrif handed me her hand and Fukuar grabbed both of us by his talons.
- Holes in the wall, with top of the scroll case sticking out of them
- William failed the constitution save from being dropped off by Fukuar
- Things found and see
	- A mace of disruption, 
	- scrolls
	- stalagmite floor to the ceiling with a belt wrapped around it
	- ornate carved chest
-  Elder Wolfe reads description on the belt and they read something about heat and fire its a very powerful magic item that enhances power. 
- Fukuar brings the Queen up with her guard
- The Queen looks at the belt and offers the belt to Thrayrift, then Thrayrift attunes to the belt
- We look at the Mace - The Queen doesn't recognize it- it emits a strong bright light when striking the undead. Occasionally when you hit someone with it will turn them to dust.
- Ildensive looks into the scrolls
	- scroll of Mortenkinnens sword
- William finds rings in the chest
	- One ring can be used defensively
	- the ring has three properties and can be expended
	- simple black band, writting in abyssal within the ring band
- Fukuar showing the circle and covering his eyes that's an illusion
- The Queen throws a rock through the circle
- Ildensive hears a clicking sound then it stops. So it was the rock bouncing around.
- Fukuar flys up and finds a ledge that is like a perch where a large animal was nesting
- Fukuar transforms under the Queen into Kitten form. He tries to help the Queen land safely
-
