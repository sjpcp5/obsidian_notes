- Fukuar stuffs lots of rope in his bag slowly
-  The rope is tight and secure checked by Thrayrift
-  Fukuar is looking down at us from the highest level above
-  William climbs well
-  Thrayrift climbs up on Athletics, 
- We figured out how to use the unmovable rod and placed it horizontal above the rope to reach the top level
- Fukuar is an a Giant Eagle/ ice Eagle from the feylands,  now and picks up Zoi and Elder Wolfe all the way up. He is struggling. He lands roughly. Zoi and Elder Wolfe have to roll a saving throw for dexterity. Fukuar licks at the water skin of Elder Wolfe.
- I try climbing the the rope and receive rope burn , The I attempt to climb again and make 2/3rds of the way up. Thrayrif handed me her hand and Fukuar grabbed both of us by his talons.
- Holes in the wall, with top of the scroll case sticking out of them
