I leveled up to level 5 eldritch knight
After a 3 day party celebration in a city
A magical leprechaun stole high magical items from use
- We decide to hunt this guy down with high stealth we enter a room full of panels that suggest a puzzle
- William finds a triangular shape pillar with three squiggly lines on it possibly fire element (fifth element symbols)
- William investigates for trap doors, He finds secret panels, 5 on the floor and one on the wall
- Akira use's an Arcana check on the floor panels Abjuration and evocation magic involved on panels
- Akira use's an Arcana check on the wall panel. If i would knock on it, it's hallow, school of illusion and evocation
- Akira use's an Arcana check and finds Abjuration and evocation, middle of the room pedestal 
- I push hard on a panel, I cut myself with a few drops of blood goes spilling on the floor near the pillar, but we notice a small dip in the pillar
- I try to drip one drop of blood on the pillar nothing happens
- William checks on plate by placing half his weight on the floor panel and nothing happens
