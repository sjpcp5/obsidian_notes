### Abilities
- ###### Weapon Bond
- At 3rd level, you learn a ritual that creates a magical bond between yourself and one weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and forge the bond.
- Once you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you can't be disarmed of that weapon unless you are incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon that weapon as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.
- You can have up to two bonded weapons, but can summon only one at a time with your bonus action. If you attempt to bond with a third weapon, you must break the bond with one of the other two.
### Actions 
	- Extra Attack: One extra attack when attacking
	- Second Wind: bonus action to regain hit points
	- Action Surge : 1 extra action and possible bonus action
	- Breath Weapon: 15 ft cone of psychic damage. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. After you use your breath weapon, you cannot use it again until you complete a short rest
	- Protection Fighting Style: within 5 feet I can protect an ally and impose disadvantage on an attacking entity


## Racial Trait - at Will
	- Psionic Mind: at will is essentially a one-way, short-range message. Being able to communicate telepathically with any creature within 30 feet of you is a potent ability. You can use this to coordinate attacks, communicate with party members during negotiations, and reason with creatures that don't share a language with you. This trait will work particularly well in builds that focus on having a high Charisma score.
	- Emerald Dragonborn are	Curious and cunning; prefer to observe while hidden behind illusions

### Find Familiar
In D&D 5e, familiars are magical spirits (either fey, fiends, or celestials) that take the shape of animals. They’re independent creatures but always follow their summoner’s commands; because they’re spirits summoned by a spell, familiars don’t require an animal handling check to influence. They also have more abilities than the average D&D animal, making Find Familiar a useful spell.[[1]](https://www.wikihow.com/Find-Familiar-5e#_note-1)

### Cantrips
#### Booming blades
_Evocation cantrip_

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self (5-foot radius)  
**Components:** S, M (a melee weapon worth at least 1 sp)  
**Duration:** 1 round

You brandish the weapon used in the spell’s casting and make a melee attack with it against one creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack’s normal effects and then becomes sheathed in booming energy until the start of your next turn. If the target willingly moves 5 feet or more before then, the target takes 1d8 thunder damage, and the spell ends.

**_At Higher Levels._** At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 thunder damage to the target on a hit, and the damage the target takes for moving increases to 2d8. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level (2d8 and 3d8) and again at 17th level (3d8 and 4d8).

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.

The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also can't be [charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Charmed), [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened), or possessed by them.
