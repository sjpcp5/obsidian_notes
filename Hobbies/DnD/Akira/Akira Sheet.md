### Abilities
- ###### Weapon Bond
- At 3rd level, you learn a ritual that creates a magical bond between yourself and one weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and forge the bond.
- Once you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you can't be disarmed of that weapon unless you are incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon that weapon as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.
- You can have up to two bonded weapons, but can summon only one at a time with your bonus action. If you attempt to bond with a third weapon, you must break the bond with one of the other two.
### Actions 
	- Extra Attack: One extra attack when attacking
	- Second Wind: bonus action to regain hit points
	- Action Surge : 1 extra action and possible bonus action
	- Breath Weapon: 15 ft cone of psychic damage. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. After you use your breath weapon, you cannot use it again until you complete a short rest
	- Protection Fighting Style: within 5 feet I can protect an ally and impose disadvantage on an attacking entity
