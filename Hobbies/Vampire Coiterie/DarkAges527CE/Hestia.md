#### Ally of Artemis 
- Hestia's story is tied strongly to Artemis 

Hestia aka (Lakshmi of Uttar) born in Uttar Pradesh, India 355 BCE.

Raised in a temple dedicated to Durga and trained to be a witch attendant of Kali. She was trained in the art of warfare, yoga and tantra. She was a priestess and warrior.

Sired into a Canite in the year 330 BCE by a Salubri named Visphala. Visphala has played a major role keeping the oral tradition of the Vedas alive from the shadows of a sect of Kali worshipers. Visphala learns of Lakshimi’s visions and approaches her after one of nightly meditations to sire her.

- She introduce herself as Hestia when meeting Alexander the Great in year 326 BCE after the battle of Hydaspes
    
- She wooed Antigonus I Monophthalmus, a General of Alexander the Great, by her sacred hearth and offered him to become her ghoul. He accepted her offer and lived to age of 81
    
- Hestia was known to become a comfort through her provision of fire, culinary arts, and sacred healing sexual practices among the Alexander’s soldiers since they longed for home.
    
- Hestia saves Nissa’s life from a fire started by hunters to drive off tigers whom Nissa was protecting. Nissa and her Tigers are bound to Hestia for life.
    
- Hestia traveled with a Gangrel named Nissa with two Bengal tigers.
    
- Eventually Hestia settled in Athens by 300 BCE after Antigonus’s death in 301 BCE, killed in the fourth Diochian War.
    
- Hestia (Lakshimi) assumed the Goddesses position in Athens and taught a matriarchal view of being Virgins, Sexual healers, Warriors, and preservers of knowledge, wills, and deeds.
    
-  The Matriarchal view as virgins meant the women were not required to bear children, or marry, they had sexual partners but during their menstrual cycle the women would practice abstinence, cleanse themselves in the river and connect with the Goddesses and God’s 
    
- Hestia is known to make people disappear who violate her priest and priestess. Typically, Nissa, one their ghouls, a head priest or priestess does the dirty work but depending on the crime Hestia will take care of it herself if a vampire violated or killed one of her flock.
