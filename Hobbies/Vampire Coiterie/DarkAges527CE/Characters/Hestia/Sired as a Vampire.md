Story of Hestia/Nemesis (Lakshimi) being sired.

Gripping the Earth as darkness covers half the world rising from the West, Macedonia. In the name of man bloodied and where’s a crown of thorns, taste of salt and water crosses over her lips as she exhales in final ritual breaths. Piercing eyes look for her from the darkness and a full moon lightens the face. She notices blood dripping from the teeth of the Goddess’s smile. Who hovers over the darkness of the land in the West. Then she sees fire roam burning through and flow. Hestia notices it holds no further than the seas that separates it from the Eastern lands for now. Lakshimi hears a soft, confident voice, “It’s time Hestia to awaken the West”. Lakshimi starts to open her eyes and wiggle her fingertips while noticing the wet dirt between her hands. Arghh she grumbles feeling the sharp needle pain of her nerves finally receiving more oxygen and blood in her numb legs as she unravels them from her lotus pose. Almost knocking over the half melted candle a half of leg’s width away. After rubbing her hands together she pulls her thighs close in and caresses her legs soothing the pain and allowing her thoughts to wander as she rocks herself. 

She hears a slow feminine voice, “You are ready Lakshimi to become Hestia”. Lakshmi feels a lightning pulse of shivers up her spin and draws her eyes to figure in the shadows. “How…do you…know…my thoughts?” The voice responds sultry, “Oh I am a peculiar secretive kind of your priestesshood.” Lakshmi remains baffled and starts to stand to her feet. Lakshmi suddenly feels a rush of wind drying the sweat off face and breastbone and then looks up to Visphala saying, “It would be best if you stay seated for this”.  

Visphala reveals, "I am the leader of the Salubri here. My burden of knowledge shapes the consciousness of humankind and us vampire kin." Visphala offers Lakshmi the kiss of life. Lakshmi accepts hesitation but knew she wouldn’t fulfill her destiny if she didn’t.
