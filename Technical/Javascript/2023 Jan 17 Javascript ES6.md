# ES6 Object-oriented Programing Javascript

- Classes - stands for classification its a way define an object
	- inheritance - example drone or car might share some functionaility 
	- Create an abstract class called Vehicle
- All objects derived from Object
- Modules - Data service class will consolidate everything. Inside the service we will have a list of cars and a list of drone objects. With functions to access the data. Functions are called methods within a class example `getCarByLicense()` &`sortCarsByMake()`
	- Having a data service keeps things simple and easy to test and won't have your data scattered all throughout your source code.
- Business Objects - This is where we create classes to model the user interface
	- we will create a button class to use buttons such as `SELF DRIVING CARS` & `DRONES`
	- We will be using Material Design Lite (similar to B)
