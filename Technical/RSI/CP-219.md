# Basic Login Page (Frontend)
#### Todos
- Presently the index page, create landing page with text fields for email and password 
- create login button
- create redirect logic to login page
- create logic to hash user's info
- create logic to send hashed user's info to OAuth server
- OAuther server sends a boolean to Frontend app
	- user id: email or hexadecimal or number
	- user authenticated: boolean
	- WHat else do I need ? Check the docs
- Create Authentication Context for logged in users
- Look up how to write routes for authentication for react router
- Look up how redirects are done for react router
#### Authentication Logic
- OpenId Connect from OneLogin will use Implicit flow for now 
- For local connection we will use the Fake OpenID Connect Authorization Server
- We will hard code users? or allow google logins? 
- Does the Fake OpenID Connect Auth Server allow our RSI google logins?
#### Future issues 
- How do we integrate the frontend with OneLogin? 
	- Check One Login React documents
		- does their process work with a landing login page? or is it Just a redirect? 
##### State management
- Authentication needs to live in React State Context
- How are we handling the state React Context API? Which is good for our needs now.
- Will we need to use Redux? (Redux state management is for heavy data handling)
