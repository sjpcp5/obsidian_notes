Deno is a simple, modern, and secure runtime for Javascript and Typescript
- Deno's name relates to Dino in the flintstones
Both Deno and Node :

Deno aims to be simple
	- one executible file 
	- builtin linter
	- builtin test runner
	- reference a package where it lives 
Secure by default so it has to have you enable the envs
Typescript 
- allows you to take advantage of the recent updates to Javascript
